         <h4>Service Experience: Oct 2018 - Oct 2020, Church Volunteer, New York City/ Taiwan</h4>
         <div class="column">
            <p>From October 2018 to October 2020, I served as a Church Volunteer in New York City and Taiwan, gaining valuable skills and experiences. I took on important roles like Assistant to the President and Zone Leader, which allowed me to develop leadership qualities, assess performance, collaborate with team members, and conduct training sessions. Our collective efforts led to a significant improvement in overall group performance.</p>
            <p>However, the COVID-19 pandemic brought unexpected challenges. The repatriation of foreigners created a shortage of workers, forcing us to quickly adapt our strategies. Changes in collaboration methods during the pandemic led to a decline in motivation among some volunteers. In my leadership role, I and a colleague helped volunteers rediscover the purpose of their service. By showing dedication, following guidance, and delivering exceptional performance, we successfully revived their enthusiasm and helped them refocus on their responsibilities. Remarkably, our post-COVID results exceeded the performance before the pandemic, highlighting our ability to overcome adversity.</p>
            <p>These experiences equipped me with a diverse skill set, ready to be applied in my future professional endeavors. While I understand the need for technical training, my ability to quickly learn and contribute in a team environment makes me a valuable asset for any organization.</p>
